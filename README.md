# trade-poc
Microservices-based Trade Settlement POC — Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Config Server for centralized configuration.

This repository showcases a microservices-based architecture for a Trade Settlement system, transitioning from a traditional monolithic design.
It contains multiple Spring Boot services, a centralized Config Server, Kafka event streaming, and PostgreSQL database integration — all orchestrated through Docker Compose for easy local deployment.
The goal is to demonstrate modular design, configuration centralization, and asynchronous communication patterns used in banking domain applications.
